# Check Rules

Check rules are perfect for finding specific issues. The LLM lists violations, and the score is calculated based on the count of violations.

## How Check Rules Work

1. **LLM analyzes content** and lists specific violations
2. **Score Calculation (Density-Based)**: VectorLint scores based on **error density (errors per 100 words)**
3. **Status**: Score < 10.0 = `warning` or `error` (based on severity)

### The "100 vs 1,000" Rule

| Document Length | Errors | Error Density | Points Lost (Standard) |
|---------------|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| 100 words | 1 | 1% | 10 points |
| 1,000 words | 1 | 0.1% | 1 point |

This makes quality assessment fair across documents of any length.

## Basic Example

```markdown
---
evaluator: base
type: check
id: GrammarChecker
name: Grammar Checker
severity: error
---

Check this content for grammar issues, spelling errors, and punctuation mistakes.

Report each error with:
- The specific text with the error
- Line number where it occurs
- The correct version or suggestion
```

### Output

```bash
Grammar Checker          ████████░░░ 6.0/10
✗ Grammar error on line 15
  → "It's" should be "Its"
✗ Spelling error on line 23
  → "recieve" should be "receive"
✗ Punctuation error on line 8
  → Missing period at end of sentence
```

## Strictness Levels

You can control penalty weight in your prompt frontmatter:

### Using Named Levels

```yaml
---
strictness: standard  # ~10 points per 1% error density
---
```

**Available levels:**

| Level | Value | Penalty per 1% error density | Use Case |
|-------|--------|----------------------------|----------|
| **lenient** | 1-3 | ~5 points | Drafts, early content |
| **standard** | 4-7 | ~10 points | General content (default) |
| **strict** | 8-10 | ~20 points | Technical docs, production |

### Using Numeric Values

```yaml
---
strictness: 5  # ~10 points per 1% error density
---
```

Direct numeric values give you fine-grained control.

## Example: Spelling Checker

```markdown
---
evaluator: base
type: check
id: SpellingChecker
name: Spelling Checker
severity: warning
strictness: lenient
---

Check this content for spelling errors.

For each error found, provide:
- The misspelled word
- Line number
- Correct spelling
- Context sentence to help user understand error

Ignore:
- Technical terms specific to the domain
- Proper names and brands
- Words with capital letters that might be acronyms
```

## Example: Link Checker

```markdown
---
evaluator: base
type: check
id: LinkChecker
name: Link Checker
severity: error
strictness: standard
---

Check this content for broken or problematic links.

For each link issue found, provide:
- The link text or URL
- Line number
- Type of issue (broken, missing protocol, malformed)
- Suggestion for fix

Check for:
- Missing http:// or https://
- Malformed URLs
- Dead links (if you can verify)
- Links to HTTP instead of HTTPS (security)
```

## Example: Terminology Checker

```markdown
---
evaluator: base
type: check
id: TerminologyChecker
name: Terminology Checker
severity: warning
strictness: standard
---

Check this content for inconsistent or incorrect terminology.

## REQUIRED TERMINOLOGY

- Use "user" not "customer"
- Use "developer" not "programmer"
- Use "application" not "app"
- Use "documentation" not "docs" (in headings)

For each terminology issue found, provide:
- The incorrect term used
- Line number
- Correct term from required list
```

## When to Use Check Rules

Use check rules when:

- You need to **find specific errors** (e.g., "Find all grammar mistakes")
- The check is **binary** (Pass/Fail) for each item
- You want a **list of specific violations** to fix
- You're checking for **countable issues** (grammar, spelling, links, etc.)

### Ideal Use Cases

| Use Case | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Grammar & Spelling** | "Find all spelling errors" |
| **Punctuation** | "Check for missing commas" |
| **Links & References** | "Find broken links" |
| **Terminology** | "Check for wrong product names" |
| **Code Examples** | "Find syntax errors in code blocks" |

## Output Format

Check rules produce output in this format:

```json
{
  "ruleId": "GrammarChecker",
  "score": 6.0,
  "violations": [
    {
      "line": 15,
      "message": "It's should be Its",
      "severity": "error"
    },
    {
      "line": 23,
      "message": "recieve should be receive",
      "severity": "error"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific About What to Check

❌ **Bad:**
```markdown
Check for issues.
```

✅ **Good:**
```markdown
Check for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors.
Report each error with specific details.
```

### 2. Provide Clear Output Format

Tell LLM exactly what to output:

```markdown
For each error, provide:
- Line number
- Error type (grammar, spelling, punctuation)
- Incorrect text
- Correct version
```

### 3. Set Appropriate Severity

- Use `error` for issues that should block deployment
- Use `warning` for suggestions that are nice to fix

### 4. Adjust Strictness by Use Case

```yaml
---
# Draft content
strictness: lenient

# Production content
strictness: strict
---
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Check

```yaml
---
type: check
id: SimpleCheck
severity: warning
---
Check for X.
Report each violation.
```

### Pattern 2: Check with Examples

```yaml
---
type: check
id: ExampleCheck
severity: error
---

Check for X.

Common issues:
- Issue A
- Issue B

Report each violation with:
- Details
- Fix suggestion
```

### Pattern 3: Check with Exclusions

```yaml
---
type: check
id: ExclusionCheck
severity: warning
---

Check for X.

Ignore:
- Excluded pattern A
- Excluded pattern B

Report violations.
```
